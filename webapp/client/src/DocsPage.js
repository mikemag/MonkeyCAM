              <p>
                MonkeyCAM is an open source CAD/CAM program for designing skis
                and snowboards, and generating G-code programs to cut board
                parts with a CNC machine. It takes configuration files to
                describe the ski or snowboard shape via a small set of
                parameters and generates the following nine G-code programs:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Base cutout</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Core:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Guide holes</strong> to allow the core to be
                      removed and flipped between programs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Alignment marks</strong> to transfer key design
                      points to the bottom of the core
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Edge relief</strong> to leave room for steel edges
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Insert holes</strong> for standard snowboard
                      inserts (T-nuts) in a variety of patterns
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Top profile</strong> to impart the taper to the
                      core
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Core cutout</strong>, allowing for sidewall
                      overhang and nose/tail spacers
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Nose and tail spacers</strong> which match the core
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Edge trenches</strong> to enable inlay of different
                  edge wood and/or sidewall material along the effective edge of
                  the core
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                MonkeyCAM also generates an overview HTML file which shows
                diagrams for all of the generated shapes and programs. Using
                this it is very easy to iterate on a design and make fine
                adjustments.
              </p>

              <h3>Configuration Files</h3>
              <p>
                MonkeyCAM uses two configuration files, one to describe the
                board and one to describe the details of how to machine the
                board. The board definition file describes the shape of the
                board, the thickness and taper of the core, placement of
                inserts, etc. The machine and tool definition file describes
                machining parameters used by various programs (rapid and various
                cutting heights and depths, raw material thicknesses, etc.) and
                parameters of each tool used.

              <h3>G-Code Programs</h3>
              <p>
                The G-Code programs generated by MonkeyCAM are designed to work
                together to create the parts necessary to build a ski or
                snowboard. This includes the core, base material, and nose/tail
                filler material.
